# Monolognator

Very simple and ugly telegram bot that detects when an annoying member writes a monologue in a group (5-12 messages without anyone else replying)

It deletes the messages from the group and writes them back as a single one.

It will also send back a gif (that needs to be available on disk currently) just before it does the Monolognation!
